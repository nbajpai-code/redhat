1.  **Pick one main comprehensive course** (e.g., Sander van Vugt or a top-rated Udemy/CBT Nuggets course).
2.  **Supplement with hands-on labs**. Watching videos is not enough; you *must* write playbooks yourself.
3.  **Focus on Ansible Core**: Understand `ansible-navigator` vs `ansible-playbook` if using RHEL 9/AAP environments.
